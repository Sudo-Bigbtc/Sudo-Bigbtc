## 🕵️‍♂️ Who Am I?

I'm an enigma wrapped in a riddle, coated in secrecy, and dipped in mystery sauce. Operating from the darkest corners of the internet (and occasionally my mom's basement), I delve into the arcane arts of black hat hacking.

## 💻 My Arsenal

- **Languages:** Python (like a snake charmer), C++ (because C was too mainstream), Assembly (assembling chaos), JavaScript (because everyone needs a bit of script kiddie in their life)
- **Tools:** Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite (yes, burps included), Nmap, Aircrack-ng, John the Ripper (not the spooky kind)
- **Platforms:** Linux (obviously), Windows (begrudgingly), MacOS (because I like shiny things)

## 🌐 My Playground

- **Dark Web:** Navigating the hidden realms like a digital ninja.
- **Pentesting:** Breaking into systems like it's a game of digital hide and seek.
- **Cryptography:** Decoding the indecipherable like a code-breaking wizard.
- **Exploit Development:** Crafting the untraceable, just like my mom's cookie recipes.

## 🔒 My Philosophy

> "The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear."  
> (Especially if you have really good headphones)

In the world of cybersecurity, knowledge is power. I explore the boundaries of technology, often stepping into the gray areas (like a curious cat who can't resist a box).

You can't. I remain a ghost in the machine. But my actions speak louder than words.
